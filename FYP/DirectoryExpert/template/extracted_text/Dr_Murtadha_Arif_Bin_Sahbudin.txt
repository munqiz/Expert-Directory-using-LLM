PROJECTS
Music Recognition
2017 - 2021
Università degli Studi di Messina, Italy
This project was the highlight of my academic 
career. I spent three years in beautiful Sicily 
exploring new and more effective algorithms for 
digital and analog music recognition.
This project was a successful collaboration 
between the EU research program and 
EarOne, a company that provided music 
recognition services throughout Europe.
Multi-Cloud Storage
2017 - 2021
Università degli Studi di Messina, Italy
This research project involves web client 
application for secure data storage in a multi-
cloud environment, focusing on confidentiality 
and integrity. I present my web application 
framework, its implementation, and evaluate it 
through experiments in a real multi-cloud 
scenario."
Geo-location Encryption
2021
University Sains Islam Malaysia
In this research project the main objectives are 
to develop a method for generating AES keys 
and to validate the system based on user 
location for encrypting and decrypting data. This 
study utilizes a Raspberry Pi 4 with the NEO GPS 
Module board (Pi-GPS).
Optical Tweezers for Space
2021
Università degli Studi di Messina, Italy & 
Universidad de Cantabria, Spain
This project uses optical trapping techniques in 
planetary exploration. Assistant developer and 
programmer to researcher Dr. Abir, utilizing 
FORTRAN for computational simulations of 
space dust.
